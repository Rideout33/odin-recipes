    <p>This side dish (or "contorno" if you want to use the Italian word) couldn't be easier! We make this often during the summer when we have an abundance of basil and parsley growing in our garden. Works well with zucchini, too.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>1 eggplant, sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>

            <li>Arrange grilled eggplant on a platter. Brush with olive oil and garlic mixture until eggplant has absorbed oil. Sprinkle with chopped basil and parsley and serve.</li>
